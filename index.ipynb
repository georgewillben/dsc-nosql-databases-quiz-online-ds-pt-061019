    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The diffrence is in how the data is stored. SQL keeps data in a tabular format while NoSQL databases store data in other          ways such as keeping the data in documents full of key-value pairs. <br>\n",
    "2) They both have their advantages and disadvantages. SQL is very popular, but there are forms of data that are not fit for SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "1) Say there is a situation a where boss wants every chatlog saved between customer service representatives and customers. A chat log might have 3 messages or 1000. It would be a poor choice to store this data in a relational database because their would have to be 1000 columns in a table to store the longest chat logs. On the contrary if this data was stored in a non relational database such as mongoDB each message could be a document within a collection of documents. If a collection was made for every customer and their customer service representative then one could find the data easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "1) MongoDB works by storing collections of documents. Each document has its own key-value pairs, can store different amounts of data, and each document does not have to share keys with other documents.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2) It is diffrent from a relational database because documents do not have to share the same keys. In a relational database every entry in the database within a table has to have the same fields (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "1) Fault tolerance is when data from one server is backed up on another server. This protects the dataset incase a server isn't running.<br>\n",
    "2) This has to do with RDD's because they store data on many diffrent servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Mapreduce is when multiple servers are used to query their share of the data and then all the results are combined to let someone conduct a massive query on a dataset that is held in many servers.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2) Hadoop uses this because it's a RDD and stores data across many servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
